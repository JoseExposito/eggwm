= Introduction = 

Egg Window Manager uses certain files for configuration. On this page you will learn what are these files and how to configure it. 



= Folders used by EggWM = 

 * *~/.eggwm* 
 The _eggwm.conf_ file contains basic information to configure the window manager. 
 The contents of this file is described later. 

 * *~/.eggwm/themes* 
 This folder containing the themes to decorate the windows. 
 Each theme is contained within a folder with the same name, which contains the files _style.qss_, _theme.inf_ 
 and other resources required for the theme, such as images. 



= Files used by EggWM =

 * *~/.eggwm/eggwm.conf*
 This file contains information on the subject that uses EggWM. Has the following structure: 
{{{ 
[Theme] 
name = Name of the theme to decorate windows 
}}} 
 Note that the theme should be properly placed in their folder. 

 * *~/.eggwm/themes/style.qss and ~/.eggwm/themes/theme.inf* 
 Theme configuration files, see the appropriate section to view its contents. 



= Configuration Example =

Below is an example of how it could be structured directory tree for the proper functioning of EggWM: 

 * ~/.eggwm 
  * eggwm.conf 
  * themes 
   * theme1 
    * ... 
   * theme2 
    * ... 

If, for example, you would use the theme of windows _theme2_, _eggwm.conf_ file would look like: 
{{{ 
[theme] 
name=theme2 
}}}
