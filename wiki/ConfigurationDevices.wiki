To facilitate Touchégg settings to other users, you can post in "Issues" tab
your touchpad name/pc name and your configuration to run Touchégg correctly.

Normally, Touchégg configuration, consists in change your touchpad
configuration to use evdev driver and _restart X._

 * *Apple Magic Trackpad:*

 Simply edit the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/60-magictrackpad.conf file and
 change the driver to evdev:
 {{{
 [...]
 # Apple Magic Trackpad
 Section "InputClass"
      Identifier "Magic Trackpad"
      MatchUSBID "05ac:030e"
      Driver "evdev"
 EndSection
 [...]
 }}}
 All gestures are detected and works fine.



 * *Asus eeepc 1000h (Buildin Elantech Trackpad)*

 Change driver from "synaptics" to "evdev" in
 /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf file:
 {{{
 Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "touchpad catchall"
    Driver "evdev"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
 EndSection
 }}}
 Not support more than three fingers gestures.
