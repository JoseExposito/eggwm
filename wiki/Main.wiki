EggWm is a window manager based on Xlib and Qt4.

The EggWM objectives are:
  * Maintain a simple and well documented source code.
  * Being 100% compatible with the EWMH and ICCCM standards.
  * Maintain low resource consumption.
  * In the future, allow to manage windows through gestures, with either a trackpad or a touchscreen.
